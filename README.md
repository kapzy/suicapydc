# suicapydc
A discord bot that packed with music playback and some other features. Written in Python.
<br>
Most of the respond that will be sent by the bot is hardcoded and is in Traditional Chinese.
<p>
  Suica the bot is not yet ready for public installation as a lot of administrative functions are not implemented. The main purpose of this project was for myself to learn python and I'm sure that I still got A WHOLE LOT to learn.
